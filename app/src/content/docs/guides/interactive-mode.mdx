# Interactive Mode

Explore JSON interactively with fuzzy search and expression building.

## Opening Interactive Mode

Open a file without an expression to enter interactive mode.

```bash
1ls readFile data.json
```

Works with all supported formats.

```bash
1ls readFile config.yaml
1ls readFile config.toml
```

## Mode 1: Path Explorer

Navigate and search JSON paths.

- **Fuzzy search:** Type to filter paths
- **Live preview:** See values as you navigate
- **Type information:** Shows String, Number, Array, Object, Boolean, or null

## Smart Tooltips

As you type expressions, 1ls provides intelligent assistance:

### Method Hints

When you type a `.` followed by characters, matching method signatures appear:

```
Search: .fil

Method hints:
› .filter(x => ...) - Filter by condition
  .find(x => ...) - Find first match
  .findIndex(x => ...) - Find first match index
```

- **Fuzzy matching:** Type partial names to find methods
- **Type-aware:** Shows methods relevant to your data type (Array, String, Object, Number)
- **Builtin tags:** Custom 1ls methods are marked with `[builtin]`

### Live Result Preview

After completing a method expression, see the evaluated result instantly:

```
Search: .filter(x => x > 2)

Result:
[3, 4, 5]
```

This helps you verify your expression works before executing it.

## Mode 2: Expression Builder

Build complex expressions with guided method selection.

## Example Session

```bash
1. Navigate to .users (Array) → Tab
2. Type "fil" → → (accepts .filter(x => ...))
3. Type "act" → → (completes with x.active)
4. Type "map" → → (accepts .map(x => ...))
5. Type "name" → → (completes with x.name)
6. Enter → executes: .users.filter(x => x.active).map(x => x.name)
```
